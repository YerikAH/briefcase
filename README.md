## Development 
### Project structure


### My experience developing

The web application allows to select colors, when the user selects a color, the entire application will change. Includes a button to change the dark theme.The development caused me a lot of trouble as I was very new to React and functional programming, but it helped me understand much more deeply how states work in React. Also use React's useContext hook, this for the app's theme and language.

This app helped me a lot, and I will reuse a lot of code, like modals, or maybe guide me on the code I wrote.
